## Features

* String caching. (for Substring replacement/s)
* Supports CSV/JSON parsing right out of the box.
* Language/Locale fallback.
* Synchronous or Asynchronous file loading for each individual file.
* Definitions file. Allows setting up new languages/files all without touching the source code. See `lexicon_index_definitions`

You're free to use, modify and contribute at your own will.
