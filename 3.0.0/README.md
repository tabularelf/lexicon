Lexicon is a localization system focused around on simplifying implementation of adding translation to your GameMaker project, whether it's on the developers end or the players end! As well as giving the flexibility in on the fly string replacement, and fallbacks to other languages/locales.

# Features

* Substring Replacement/s. (Replacing `{0-9999}`, or `{name_of_variable}` via structs!)
* String caching. (for Substring replacement/s)
* Supports CSV/JSON parsing right out of the box.
* Language/Locale fallback.
* Synchronous or Asynchronous file loading for each individual file.
* Definitions file. Allows setting up new languages/files all without touching the source code. See `lexicon_index_definitions`

You're free to use, modify and contribute at your own will.
